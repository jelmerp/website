I am a computational evolutionary biologist, currently using genomic data to study diversification of Madagascar's mouse lemurs in [Anne Yoder's lab](http://yoderlab.org/) at Duke University. Previously, I've worked on sympatric speciation and admixture in Cameroon crater lake cichlids, and on coloration genetics and speciation genomics in European crows. See my [Research](/research/) and [Publications](/publication/) pages for more details.

In my free time, I like to head outside to play soccer and most of all to go birding --- locally and all across the world (see my [Birding](/birding/) page).
