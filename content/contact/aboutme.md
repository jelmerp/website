I grew up in a small town called Surhuisterveen in the province of Fryslân in The Netherlands. I have been interested in nature and particularly birds since I was a small child. At the age of 11, I joined the [Jeugdbond voor Natuur- en Milieustudie](https://www.jnm.nl/) (JNM; this translates to "youth club for the study of nature and the environment") and with them, I went on countless excursions and camps across the country and beyond, looking for and identifying birds, butterflies, plants and so on. This prompted me to study Biology in college, and with Fryslân having not a single university, I moved to the rival neighbor province of Groningen to study at the [RuG](https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en).

For my MSc, I first did a field-based project on song divergence and associated behavioural responses in Gray-breasted Wood-Wrens in Ecuador. While I had little to no appetite for genetics when I started studying biology, my interest in speciation eventually turned that on it's head. My first forray into genetics was during my next MSc project when I Sanger sequenced a bunch of loci to then study population genetic differentiation among populations of monarch flycatchers.

For my PhD, I went to Uppsala University in Sweden, studying genomics in Carrion and Hooded Crows, an iconic pair of bird taxa (well, iconic in some circles). I say taxa because they are considered two subspecies belonging to the same species by some taxonomic authorities, and two separate species by others. TBC
