I grew up in a small town called Surhuisterveen in the province of Fryslân in The Netherlands. I have been interested in nature and particularly birds since I was a small child. At the age of 11, I joined the [Jeugdbond voor Natuur- en Milieustudie](https://www.jnm.nl/) (JNM; this translates to "youth club for the study of nature and the environment") and with them, I went on countless excursions and camps across the country and beyond, looking for and identifying birds, butterflies, plants and so on. This prompted me to study Biology in college, and with Fryslân having not a single university, I moved to the rival neighbor province of Groningen to study at the [RuG](https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en).

For my MSc, I first did a field-based project on song divergence and associated behavioural responses in gray-breasted wood-wrens in Ecuador. While I had little to no appetite for genetics when I started studying biology, my interest in speciation eventually turned that on it's head. My first forray into genetics was during my next MSc project when I Sanger-sequenced about a dozen loci to study divergence and gene flow between populations of monarch flycatchers.

For my PhD, I went to Uppsala University in Sweden, studying the genetics of plumage coloration and the genomics of speciation in carrion and hooded crows, which famously hybridize in a narrow zone that runs through the middle of Europe. I then bravely left birds behind for the first time in my research career as I moved to Chapel Hill in North Carolina, US, for a 1-year postdoc on speciation in cichlid fish. I am currently at nearby Duke University in Durham, studying the diversification history of the smallest primates on earth: mouse lemurs.
