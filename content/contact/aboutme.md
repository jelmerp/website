I grew up in a small town called Surhuisterveen in the province of Fryslân in The Netherlands. I have been interested in nature, particularly birds, since I was a small child.

As a young teenager, I joined the [Jeugdbond voor Natuur- en Milieustudie](https://www.jnm.nl/) ("youth club for the study of nature and the environment"). With the JNM, I went on countless excursions and camps across the country and beyond, looking for and identifying birds, butterflies, plants and so on.

This prompted me to study Biology in college, and since Fryslân doesn't have a single university, I moved to the rival neighbor province of Groningen to study at the [Rijksuniversiteit Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en). I did my PhD in evolutionary genetics at Uppsala University in Sweden, and next went to North Carolina in the US for postdocs at UNC Chapel Hill and Duke University. Nearly all of my research has revolved around speciation, genomics, and the intersection of the two --- see my [Research](/research/) and [Publications](/publication/) pages for more details.
