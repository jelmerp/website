 abstract = {Song divergence between closely related taxa may play a critical role in the evolutionary processes of speciation and hybridization. We explored song variation between two Ecuadorian subspecies of the gray-breasted wood-wren (Henicorhina leucophrys) and tested the impact of song divergence on response behaviors. Songs were significantly different between the two subspecies, even between two parapatric populations 10 km apart. Playback experiments revealed an asymmetric response pattern to these divergent subspecies specific songs; one subspecies responded more to songs of its own subspecies than to the other subspecies' songs, whereas the second responded equally strongly to songs of both subspecies. While song parameters revealed a mixed pattern of divergence between allopatric and parapatric populations, the majority of spectral characteristics showed increased divergence in parapatry, suggestive of character displacement. This increased song divergence in parapatry appeared to affect behavioral responses to playback as discriminating responses were most prominent in parapatry and against parapatric songs. The clear behavioral impact of subspecies-specific song differences supports a potential role for song as an acoustic barrier to gene flow. The asymmetric nature of the responses suggests that song divergence could affect the direction of gene flow and the position of the subspecies-specific transition.},
