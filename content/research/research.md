## Speciation
It is an exciting time to study evolutionary biology and speciation. As a research field that is largely focused on historical events, modern high-throughput sequencing approaches offer unprecedented opportunities to make inferences about said events. This is particularly true for non-model systems with limited experimental options. In combination with theoretical and particularly computational advances, we can now obtain and then attempt to read the genome ["like a history book"](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6368/1265.2) for any organism. My PhD and postdoctoral research has focused on using genomics to advance our understanding of speciation, and I have tried to do this in a variety of non-model organisms: crows, cichlid fish, and lemurs.

That mystery of mysteries, the origin of species, has always interested me. As a traveling naturalist, it is hard not to be confronted with -- and wonder about -- processes behind dissimilarities and similarities between closely related species, hybridization between them, and patterns in their geographic distributions and ecology. I was slow to gain an interest in genetics as an undergrad, and the penny only really dropped during an MSc research project on song divergence as a behavioral mechanism of isolation between two hybridizing subspecies of the Gray-breasted Wood-Wren (see [Dingle et al. 2010](/publication/dingle-asymmetric-2010/index.html) and [Halfwerk et al. 2016](/publication/halfwerk-sharp-2016/index.html)). These birds were morphologically highly similar and vocally divergent, but since their songs are learned, we needed genetic methods to assign individuals. At the same time, this genetic work also revealed how highly divergent these subspecies were, despite looking nearly identical.

## Mouse lemurs
Mouse lemurs (genus _Microcebus_) are the smallest primates on earth and are endemic to Madagascar, like the entire so-called superfamily of lemurs. Until recently, they were thought to comprise only two species, but genetic work has shown that there is much diversity hidden within these highly cryptic, nocturnal creatures. Together with my adviser Anne Yoder and -- among others -- collaborators George Tiley and Jordi Salmoni, I have mostly worked on a large and growing RADseq dataset of all 24 presently described species of mouse lemur to investigate phylogeny, patterns of diversification, demographic histories, and 
gene flow within and among species.

We have a [preprint](/publication/schusler-cryptic-2019/index.html) of a study of five species of mouse lemurs up, which confirms a lineage hitherto called "M. sp. nova #3" as a distinct taxon while calling into question the distinctness of two other species. We estimated rates of gene flow (finding evidence for mitochondrial introgression) and divergence times, and interestingly, find that two pairs of species occur sympatrically without gene flow despite having diverged well under a million years ago. Along the same lines, I have found that previously suspected hybridization and introgression between two other mouse lemur species, also diverged less than 1 ma ago, is not supported by RADseq data and that these species appear to have rapidly evolved reproductive isolation (unpublished data). Other projects include an investigation of genomic divergence associated with local adaptation in _M. griseorufus_, modeling divergence and gene flow among all close sister species, and creating a dated phylogeny for all described species. Finally, we have a [preprint](/publication/campbell-pedigree-based-2019/index.html) up on an estimation of the de novo mutation rate based on deep whole-genome sequencing of a known pedigree of mouse lemurs from the Duke Lemur Center.
