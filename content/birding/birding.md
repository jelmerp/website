## Observations
- [My eBird profile page](https://ebird.org/profile/MzI4MzE5/world/)
- [My observation.org profile page](https://waarneming.nl/users/13020/)
- [My waarneming.nl profile page](https://observation.org/user/view/13020)

I only started using eBird in 2016, and almost none of my previous sightings are on  eBird as of now. Before eBird, I used the Swedish site [Artportalen](https://artportalen.se/) for sightings in Sweden while living there. I've also used the Dutch websites [waarneming.nl](https://waarneming.nl/) for sighting in The Netherlands and [observation.org](https://observation.org/) for sightings elsewhere. One day, I'll need to pull all of this together, and also enter old sightings that were not digitally logged at all, of which there are many...
