## Observations
- __[My eBird profile page](https://ebird.org/profile/MzI4MzE5/world/)__
- [My observation.org profile page](https://waarneming.nl/users/13020/)
- [My waarneming.nl profile page](https://observation.org/user/view/13020)

I only started using eBird after I moved to the US in the fall of 2016, and as of now, hardly any of my previous observations are on eBird. Before eBird, I used [Artportalen](https://artportalen.se/) while living in Sweden, and the Dutch websites [waarneming.nl](https://waarneming.nl/) for observations in The Netherlands and [observation.org](https://observation.org/) for sightings elsewhere. One day, I'll need to get all of that -- and older, non-digitally recorded observations -- onto eBird.

## Sound recordings
- [My Xeno-Canto profile page](https://www.xeno-canto.org/contributor/RKAYEOOLQW)

I have long been interested in bird vocalizations and have made thousands of sound recordings through the years, starting in 2006 with a little voice recorder... Some of those, over 900 as of Jan. 2020, can be found on [Xeno-Canto](https://www.xeno-canto.org/). Several have also been published as audio accompanying books and articles.

  An article in the Dutch Birding's *Trends in Systematics* series summarizing papers on hybrid speciation in sparrows: as has long been suspected and was recently confirmed by genomic data, the Italian Sparrow is a hybrid species with House and Spanish Sparrows as the parental species. See [here](https://www.dutchbirding.nl/journal/pdf/DB_2015_37_4.pdf#page=41) for a pdf.

## Guiding
I have designed and guided two 5-day group birding tours to Central Sweden for [Birding Breaks](https://www.birdingbreaks.nl/) that took place in April 2016 and April 2017. Our main targets were owls (Great Grey, Ural, Pygmy, Hawk, and Tengmalm's), grouse (Capercaillie, Hazelhen, Rock Ptarmigan, and Willow Grouse), Siberian Jay, Siberian Tit, and Three-toed Woodpecker. I am set to lead a tour to the migrant traps along the northern shore of Lake Ontario in Canada in May 2020 (trip website [here](https://www.birdingbreaks.nl/vogelreis_canada_point_pelee)). See also my personal Birding Breaks page [here](https://www.birdingbreaks.nl/reisleider_jelmer_poelstra).
